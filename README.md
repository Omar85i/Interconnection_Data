# Interconnection_Data
Interconnection training dataset; Interconnection test set for validation; Trained DNNs and ELM/WELM models
% A MatLab file called 'Data_repository.m' contains the relevant data used to prepare the paper called 'Detection of Interconnections Between Unstable Resonant Orbits Via Machine Learning' 
% In Data_repository.m the performance of the trained models is evaluated throught the processing of the test set
